Working prototype, uses a clamping mechanism to hold the entire assembled Xtion
heatsink, including the factory-mounted PCB and cameras.

The design sacrifices weight savings for ease of mounting and use; this
prototype should not require calibration and dissipates heat as well or better
than the fully assembled Xtion.
