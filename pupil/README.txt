While care has been taken to be as accurate as possible, these models are
reverse-engineered using hand measurements and rough photographs of the pupil
headset, and as such they are APPROXIMATE. The actual headset may differ from
these designs by as much as a 1-2mm, notably in the precise shape of the curves
and the nose-rests.

The "full" model lacks the characteristic camera and eye-tracker, but shows
where these are mounted.
