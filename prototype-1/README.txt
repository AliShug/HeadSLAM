Lightweight design which mounts well (the clamps remained unchanged in the later
prototypes), but with several problems. The PCB was intended to be mounted flat,
which was impossible since the surface components on the board prevented it from
being placed flush. The mounting of the cameras and projector directly onto a
3D-printed part also proved impractical, since the Xtion would have to be
extensively re-calibrated.
