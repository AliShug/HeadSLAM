This prototype still had the problem of requiring a difficult recalibration, and
didn't provide sufficient heat dissipation. A minor redesign allowed use of a
modified (cut-down) heatsink as part of the design, but removing the cameras
from their mountings (even when replacing them in their original positions)
would still have negatively affected calibration.
