While care has been taken to be as accurate as possible, these models are
reverse-engineered using hand measurements, and as such they are APPROXIMATE.
This mostly affects the heatsink, which was modelled with straight sides which
should in fact be slightly tapered.

The heatsink model lacks some holes and mounting points for the PCB. The
heatsink's precise design may also differ slightly between different models of
the Xtion.

With the exception of connection points, the PCB model lacks representation on
on-surface components. Care should be taken when designing e.g. mounts for the
PCB to account for the extra 1-2mm of clearance needed for these parts, on BOTH
sides of the board. Areas immediately (2-3mm) around the screw holes are clear
on both sides.
